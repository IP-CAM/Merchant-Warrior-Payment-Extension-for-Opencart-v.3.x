# Opencart Merchant Warrior

This extension (payment module) adds support for the Merchant Warrior payment gateway for your OpenCart store ( https://www.merchantwarrior.com/ ).

Merchant Warrior is an Australian based Payment Gateway offering online payment solutions to Merchants around the world.

Merchant Warrior offers its clients a robust processing gateway by combining a vast range of advanced features and tools, which are made available through a simplistic interface.

This particular version of the extension is basically a conversion of this free original opencart 2.x extension ( https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=28481 ) to opencart 3.x.
But it also improved by integrating the optional support of the "hosted payments" feature (which also supports 3-D Secure).


## Installation 
Supported opencart version: 3.x
- Install the module package merchantwarrior.ocmod.zip using the standard opencart extension installer. 
- Enable (install) the extension in the list of payment modules.
- Set API key, merchant UID, password, etc. and enable the module on the module setting page.


## Support and modification 

The extension is free to use, copy and/or modify.
