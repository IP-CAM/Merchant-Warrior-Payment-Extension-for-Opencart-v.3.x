# opencart-merchant-warrior

This extension (payment module) adds support for the Merchant Warrior payment gateway for your OpenCart store ( https://www.merchantwarrior.com/ ).

Merchant Warrior is an Australian based Payment Gateway offering online payment solutions to Merchants around the world.

Merchant Warrior offers its clients a robust processing gateway by combining a vast range of advanced features and tools, which are made available through a simplistic interface.

This particular version of the extension is basically a conversion of this free original opencart 2.x extension ( https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&extension_id=28481 ) to opencart 3.x.
But it also improved by integrating the optional support of the "hosted payments" feature (which also supports 3-D Secure).


If you need any support for the extension, please contact at support@liveopencart.com
